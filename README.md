•	Transaction History: View recent transactions.

##Technologies Used
•	Backend: Django (Python Web Framework)
•	Database: SQLite (for development/testing)
•	Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (Django Templates)
•	Dependencies: (See requirements.txt for a full list)
–	Django
–	crispy-forms, crispy-bootstrap5
–	bcrypt (for password hashing)
–	Flask (some Flask-related dependencies are present, but the core application is Django)

##Setup Instructions
To set up and run the project locally, follow these steps:
1.	Clone the repository:
 	git clone <repository_url>
cd securebanking22
2.	Create a virtual environment and activate it:
 	python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
3.	Install dependencies:
 	pip install -r requirements.txt
4.	Apply database migrations:
 	python manage.py migrate
5.	Create a superuser (for manager access):
 	python manage.py createsuperuser
6.	Run the development server:
 	python manage.py runserver
 	The application will be accessible at http://127.0.0.1:8000/.

##Security Considerations
This application incorporates several security measures, including Django’s built-in authentication and authorization, CSRF protection, and input validation. A detailed security report, security_report.pdf, provides an in-depth analysis of the implemented security features, identified areas for improvement, and additional recommendations for enhancing the application’s security posture. It covers topics such as secure communication protocols, data encryption, logging, and incident response.
